The instructions may look lenghty, but they're simple and just explained in detail, so please don't click away. I would highly recommend you having a look at the codebase and trying the app for yourself.

### 1: Install the PIP packages/dependencies

cd into the repo folder and run the following command in cmd/terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3: It's done ðŸŽ‰ | Run the app

Run `Bank_Accounts_Manager_main.py` file with python 3 and you should see the login window, if you have followed each step correctly.
